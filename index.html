                <p class="text-muted text-left">They had a democratic government and received food as payment. The reason for this was that no one believed in money. They believed that the only things that mattered were food and water. They worship Sinaratha, a single goddess who provided people with water and food based on their wisdom and bravery. They developed the skill of music and employed it as a healing tool, while music comforts us. Scientists and experts are still puzzled as to how they achieved it, but the tribe died out due to overcrowding in a relatively short time. The well-known language is Rezusatha. The ending of everything on the island is -tha. Magbseictha is a common boy's name (Mag-bee-s-e-ii-caa-tha). Briatha is a popular girl's name (Buh-ree-aa-tha). Renonats modify their names when they reach adulthood. So, Magbseictha becomes Manrthentha (Mas-duh-w-aa-r-duh-tha), and Briatha becomes Mabnatha (Muh-bha-nah-tha). Common names for boys: Lumlytha, Tursitha. Common names for girls: laritha, Yustha, Larnitha's.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">This island is located in the South Indian Ocean. It is a remote tropical island, with a single volcano in the middle of the island. Scientists says that the island was around 2 km squared before it mysteriously disappeared from the face of the Earth; some say that the ocean completely submerged the island. Others say that aliens were responsible. The only evidence they were able to find of the island was the fact that there was a elevation in the sea that contained fossils of trees, suspiciously recent, it seemed.</p>

It had majestic Volcanoes, hot springs, magnificent waterfalls, and its famed underwater cemetery.</p>

The island was only recently discovered, and it was thought to have been destroyed a long time ago. The Renonat tribe was not particularly friendly, and anyone who sailed too close was never seen again.</p>

There are two festivals: both of them are called the “Festival of Dirt”. Minartha and Hantha are two festivals that are also about celebrating the coming of the year.

                <p>Scientists found samples of the island's dirt underground. After performing some tests, they found out that this soil was no ordinary soil. Everytime you planted a crop in this soil, it grew instantly. With more studies, they found out that this soil was made out of premium air and water particles that have never been heard of. Scientists think the water may also contain rare substances that could be used in brewing “potions” of astounding properties.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">William Saucernaut was an archaeologist and the leader of the founding Renonat research team. He was born in 1977 in the outskirts of London, and he was interested in his country’s history at a young age. William decided to pursue his interests and  eventually attended Stonehenge University, obtaining a master degree in archaeology. After becoming a traveling journalist for a while, he found his dream job in Australia and quickly received respect, eventually accumulating his very own team of scientists. There, he and his team would discover Renonat for the first time. “I was just checking the sensors, making sure everything was going well, when one of my teammates came up to me with this photograph. All the signs pointed it to it being a sort of a computer glitch, but it wasn’t. The more we investigated it, the more real it was. I was astounded, like I’ve never seen anything like it before.” To this day, he is still researching this mysterious tribe.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Nearby what researchers think is the site of Renonat Island lies Clue Island, a small rocky atoll. Clue Island is named appropriately because of the clues it has given that may answer some of the Renonat’s deepest questions, and unassuming it might be, it still remains a vital part of the mystery. The majority of experts believe that the Renonats inhabited Clue Island briefly before they disappeared, as evidence of tools and statues deep in the island’s caves suggest. The caves reveal more about the island civilization: sketches and carvings that may reveal that the Renonats were more technologically advanced than previously thought, abundant and easily accessible samplings of magical dirt that couldn’t be thoroughly investigated before, and much more. Clue Island remains a valued source of information, and it’s a key to uncovering the life of the Renonats. Make sure to annotate the last sentence.</p>
